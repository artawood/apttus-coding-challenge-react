# apttus-coding-challenge-react

The assignment is to create a React SPA that shows the result of running this search API in a paginated table grid. Here are the general set of requirements:

1. User should be able to reorder (sort) the table by any of the columns

2. User should be able to filter the data on ‘stars’, ‘license’ and ‘forks’ – you can create a separate component to facilitate filtering

3. Clicking on the ‘name’ cell in the table should navigate the user to a view that shows more details about the repository (maybe the Readme.md as well)

Please make your code commented, modular, and neatly packaged as a deployable bundle, and available on a public GitHub repo for review – so that we can clone it and run it locally.
